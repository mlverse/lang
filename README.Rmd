Use an **LLM to translate a function's help documentation on-the-fly**. `lang` 
overrides the `?` and `help()` functions in your R session. If you are using 
RStudio or Positron, the translated help page will appear in the Help 
pane. 

## Installing

To install the GitHub version of `lang`, use:

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("mlverse/lang")
```

## Using `lang`

In order to work, `lang` needs two things: 
  
  1. An LLM 
  
  1. A target language (e.g.: Spanish, French, Korean)

Both can be defined using `lang_use()`, and then access translated help 
by using `help()` or `?`.

This example shows how to use Llama 3.2, via Ollama, to
translate the `lm()` function's help into Spanish:

```r
library(lang)

lang_use("ollama", "llama3.2", .lang = "spanish")

?lm
```

### LLM

There are two ways to define the LLM that `lang` will use during the R session.

1. Use an  `ellmer` chat object: 

    ```r
    library(lang)
    
    lang_use(backend = ellmer::chat_openai(model = "gpt-4o"))
    ```

1. Use local LLMs available through [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Pass `"ollama"` 
as the `backend` argument, and specify which installed  model to use:

    ```r
    lang_use(backend = "ollama", model = "llama3.2", seed = 100)
    ```
    
    Under the hood, `lang` uses the  [`ollamar`](https://hauselin.github.io/ollama-r/) 
    package to integrate with Ollama. Any additional arguments, such as `seed` 
    as shown above, will be passed as-is to `ollamar`'s `chat()` function. 

### Automatically set 

If present, the *.Rprofile* file runs at the beginning of any R session. If you
wish to automatically set the model and language to use, add a call to `llm_use()`
to this file.  You can call `usethis::edit_r_profile()` to open your .Rprofile
file so you can add the option. 

Here is an example of such a call that could be used in the .Rprofile file:

```r
lang::lang_use(
  backend = "ollama", 
  model = "llama3.2", 
  .cache = "~/help-translations/", 
  .lang = "spanish",
  .silent = TRUE
  )
```

In the example, we set `.silent` to `TRUE` so that there is no message every time
we restart the R session.


After setup, simply use `?` to trigger and display the translated documentation.
During translation, `lang` will display its progress by showing which section
of the documentation is currently translating: 

```r
> ?lm
#> [1/7] ■■                                 4% | Title
```

If your environment is set to use the Spanish language, the help pane should
display this:

<img src="man/figures/lm-spanish.png" align="center" width="100%"
alt="Screenshot of the lm function's help page in Spanish"/>

R enforces the printed name of each section, so they cannot be
translated. So titles such as Description, Usage and Arguments will always
remain untranslated. 


## How it works

The language that the help documentation will be translated to, is determined by
one of the following two environment variables. In order of priority, the 
variables are:

1. `LANGUAGE`
1. `LANG`

It is likely that your `LANG` variable  already defaults to your locale. 
For example, mine is set to: `en_US.UTF-8` (That means English, United States). 
For someone in France, the locale would be  something such as `fr_FR.UTF-8`. 
Llama3.2, recognizes these UTF locales, and using `lang`, calling `?` will 
result in translating the function's help documentation into French. 

It uses the `mall` package as the integration point with the LLM. Under the hood,
it runs `llm_vec_translate()` multiple times to translate the most common 
sections of the help documentation (e.g.: Title, Description, Details,
Arguments, etc.).  If `lang` determines that your environment is set to use 
English, it will simply display the original documentation. 

## Considerations

### Translations are not perfect

As you can imagine, the quality of translation will mostly depend on the LLM 
being used. This solution is meant to be as helpful as possible, but 
acknowledging that at this stage of LLMs, only a human curated translation
will be the best solution. Having said that, I believe that even an imperfect
translation could go a long way with someone who is struggling to understand
how to use a specific function in a package, and may also struggle with the
English language.

### Debug

If the original English help page displays, check your environment variables:

```{r}
Sys.getenv("LANG")
Sys.getenv("LANGUAGE")
```

In my case, `lang` recognizes that the environment is set to English, because
of the `en` code in the variable. If your `LANG` variable is set to `en_...` 
then no translation will occur.

If this is your case, set the `LANGUAGE` variable to your preference. You can
use the full language name, such as 'spanish', or 'french', etc.  You can use
`Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = "[my language]")`, or, for a more permanent solution, 
add the entry to your your .Renviron file (`usethis::edit_r_environ()`). 

### Interaction with `mall`

`lang` uses the `mall` package to produce the translations. To avoid conflicts
in the setup and use of both packages during the R session, `lang` runs `mall`
in a separate R process which is only alive while translating the documentation.
This means that you can have a specific LLM setup for `lang`, and a different
one for `mall` during your R session.
