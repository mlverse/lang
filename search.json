During translation, lang will display its progress by showing which section of the documentation is currently translating:\n&gt; ?lm\nTranslating: Title\nIf your environment is set to use the Spanish language, the help pane should display this:\n\nR enforces the printed name of each section, so they cannot be translated. So titles such as Description, Usage and Arguments will always remain untranslated."

    "text": "How it works\nThe language that the help documentation will be translated to, is determined by one of the following two environment variables. In order of priority, the variables are:\n\nLANGUAGE\nLANG\n\nIt is likely that your LANG variable already defaults to your locale. For example, mine is set to: en_US.UTF-8 (That means English, United States). For someone in France, the locale would be something such as fr_FR.UTF-8. Llama3.2, recognizes these UTF locales, and using lang, calling ? will result in translating the function’s help documentation into French.\nIt uses the mall package as the integration point with the LLM. Under the hood, it runs llm_vec_translate() multiple times to translate the most common sections of the help documentation (e.g.: Title, Description, Details, Arguments, etc.). If lang determines that your environment is set to use English, it will simply display the original documentation."

This solution is meant to be as helpful as possible, but acknowledging that at this stage of LLMs, only a human curated translation will be the best solution. Having said that, I believe that even an imperfect translation could go a long way with someone who is struggling to understand how to use a specific function in a package, and may also struggle with the English language.\n\n\nDebug\nIf the original English help page displays, check your environment variables:\nSys.getenv(\"LANG\")\n#&gt; [1] \"en_US.UTF-8\"\nSys.getenv(\"LANGUAGE\")\n#&gt; [1] \"\"\nIn my case, lang recognizes that the environment is set to English, because of the en code in the variable. If your LANG variable is set to en_... then no translation will occur.\nIf this is your case, set the LANGUAGE variable to your preference. You can use the full language name, such as ‘spanish’, or ‘french’, etc. You can use Sys.setenv(LANGUAGE = \"[my language]\"), or, for a more permanent solution, add the entry to your your .Renviron file (usethis::edit_r_environ())."
