## lang_use

## Description
Allows us to specify the back-end provider, model to use during the current R session.


## Usage
```r

lang_use(backend = NULL, model = NULL, .cache = NULL, ...)
```

## Arguments
|Arguments|Description|
|---|---|
| backend | "ollama" or an `ellmer` `Chat` object. If using "ollama", `mall` will use is out-of-the-box integration with that back-end. Defaults to "ollama". |
| model | The name of model supported by the back-end provider |
| .cache | The path to save model results, so they can be re-used if the same operation is ran again. To turn off, set this argument to an empty character: `""`. It defaults to a temp folder. If this argument is left `NULL` when calling this function, no changes to the path will be made. |
| ... | Additional arguments that this function will pass down to the integrating function. In the case of Ollama, it will pass those arguments to `ollamar::chat()`. |



## Value
Console output of the current LLM setup to be used during the R session.


## Examples
```{r}

 
  library(lang)
  
  # Using an `ellmer` chat object
  lang_use(ellmer::chat_openai(model = "gpt-4o"))
  
  # Using Ollama directly
  lang_use("ollama", "llama3.2", seed = 100)
  
  # Turn off cache by setting it to ""
  lang_use("ollama", "llama3.2", seed = 100, .cache = "")




```
